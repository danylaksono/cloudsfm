Open source, online webservice Structure from Motion 


## !!DISCLAIMER!!
This project have been moved to a Google Colab Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fEiRxvyX_GsEDofvNybndQmRWgbquqfd?usp=sharing). I planned to do more updates on the Notebook as a [Streamlit App](https://www.streamlit.io/), but that should wait for the moment.


This project aim to provide a fully automatic Structure from Motion and Multi-view Reconstruction using open source software. This project is part of a reseach in Department of Geodetic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Gadjah Mada University, and is still in early development phase.

This project uses the following software:
    * OpenMVG
    * MVE
    * FSSR
    * MVS-Texturing
    * Potree

License are limited to each of the software respectively
